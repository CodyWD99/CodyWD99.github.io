At 18 years old I moved out of my stepdads house to live with a friend. Pretty much immediatley, I had to take on labor jobs, the first of which, was a pipe yard that only paid $8.50 an hour and required 12+ hours of work 7 days a week! Obviously I didn't stay there too long. After the pipe yard I bounced around all kinds of jobs, all of which were in the heat. I learned some valuable skills that I'll forever be grateful for but ofcourse, I quickly started to think that a life of strenuous work in very hot environments was not for me but, I also knew that I wasn't cut out or even financially stable enough to go to college so I felt stuck in life until my roommate told me about Flatiron. He told me about how no prior skills were needed, about the income share aggreement and about the job offer at the end of the course and I instantly had hope. I've always wanted a career around computers but I thought that those kind of jobs were reserved for the intellectually gifted and not for someone lilke me. I started looking into Flatiron myself and just became more convinced that this is the route I should take.
